# 🎓 **EduLms – Integrated Learning Management System for Structured Education and Quality Practice**

**EduLms** is a lightweight and structured **Learning Management System (LMS)** repository  
that integrates **ISO 9001 / ISO 14001**, **QC tools**, **training modules**, and **FSM-based process visualization**.  
It supports **educational reuse**, **documentation templates**, and **process visibility** through **Markdown + Git** architecture.

> 💡 **What is an LMS (Learning Management System)?**  
> An LMS is not just about training delivery, but a system that manages learning holistically —  
> including **training plans**, **material organization**, **competence tracking**, and **progress evaluation**.  
> EduLms expresses this structure using **Markdown**, **Git**, and **Mermaid diagrams**.
