# 🎓 EduLms - Integrated Learning Management System for Structured Education and Quality Practice

**EduLms** is a lightweight and structured **Learning Management System (LMS)** repository  
that integrates ISO 9001 / ISO 14001, QC tools, training, and FSM-based process visualization.  
It supports **educational reuse, documentation templates, and management process visualization**  
through Markdown and Git-based architecture.

> 💡 **What is an LMS (Learning Management System)?**  
> An LMS is not just about training delivery, but refers to a system that manages learning as a whole —  
> including training plans, material structure, competence records, and progress tracking.  
> EduLms implements this using Markdown, Git, and visual models.
